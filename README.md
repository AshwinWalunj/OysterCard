# OysterCard

This is a simple and lean solutio for the Oyster Card Problem.

# StationInfo.java
I have created a class called StationInfo which contains the names of stations and in which zones they lie.
This class has getter and setter method for adding the cities and their zones and even a method to return in which zone the particular city lies

# Card.java
This class acts as a virtual card for the customer and stores the balance of the customer.
We have the getBalance() for fetching the balance of the customer and setBalance() for updating the value of the card.

# Calculator.java
This class has method calculateCost which claculates the cost for each journey and updates the card balance of the custoemr.

# Main.java
This is the main class where I am assigning values to the object of StationInfo and then calling the function of the Calculator class to calculate the cost.
and lastly I display the cost of travelling and the card balance.
